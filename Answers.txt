How would you deploy this application in production?


What other components would I want to add to make this production ready?



How can this application scale with a growing data set?

To scale this, it would need to be re-written to use async capabilities.

How can PII be recovered later on?
You would need to store the original PII data as well as the matching hashed values
in a safe location in order to be able to recover PII.

What are the assumptions you made
One assumption that i made is of using python, although we can take some other language as well if speed is priority.
